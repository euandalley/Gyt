# Gyt

A copy of the popular program Git I made in order to try and understand how it works. Written in Python 3.10.

## Install

Clone the project and run `python3 setup.py develop --user` in the root directory. Now you can run `gyt [command name]` from the list of working commands.

## Features

Current working commands:
- init
- hash-object
- cat-file
- commit (Still in progress)

## Acknowledgement

This implementation is based off the tutorial found at https://www.leshenko.net/p/ugit/
